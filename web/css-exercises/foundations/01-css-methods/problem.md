# Problem

In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors (e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

- `div:` a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
- `p:` a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
- `button:` an orange background and a font size of 18p

## Self Check

- [ ] Did you use all three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file?
- [ ] Did you properly link the external CSS file in the HTML file?
- [ ] Does the div element have CSS added via the external method?
- [ ] Does the p element have CSS added via the internal method?
- [ ] Does the button element have CSS added via the inline method?
