# Problem Task

There are several elements in the HTML file provided, which you will have to add either class or ID attributes to, as noted in the outcome image below. You will then have to add rules in the CSS file provided using the correct selector syntax. Look over the outcome image carefully, and try to keep in mind which elements look similarly styled (classes), which ones may be completely unique from the rest (ID), and which ones have slight variations from others (multiple classes).

The properties you need to add to each element are:

- All odd numbered elements: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing Verdana and DejaVu Sans with sans-serif as a fallback
- The second element: blue text and a font size of 36px
- The third element: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px
- The fourth element: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold

## Desired Outcome

## Self Check

- [x] Do the odd numbered p elements share a class?
- [x] Do the even numbered div elements have unique IDs?
- [x] Does the Number 3 element have multiple classes?
